Pagination for Leptos.

This crate contains hooks and components for easy pagination of data.
It provides efficient loading, caching and displaying of large data. At the same time it
is very easy to use even for small datasets.

### Usage

```rust
// Implement one of the loader traits for this struct (not shown here, see below).
pub struct BookLoader;

let state = PaginationState::new_store();

view! {
    <ul>
        <PaginatedFor loader=BookLoader query=() state item_count_per_page=10 let:idx_book>
            // idx_book is a tuple containing the index and the book data
            <li>{idx_book.1.title}</li>
        </PaginatedFor>
    </ul>

    <PaginationPrev state>"Prev"</PaginationPrev>
    <PaginationNext state>"Next"</PaginationNext>

    <nav>
        <PaginationPages state />
    </nav>
}
```

### Loading data

Loading data is done through implementing one of the various `Loader` traits. Depending on your use case
you should implement the trait that best fits your needs:

- [`MemoryLoader`]: If your dataset is already in memory like in a `Vec`, `HashSet`, array, ...
- [`PaginatedLoader`]: If your data source provides data in pages (independent of if you use UI pagination or virtualization).
- [`ExactLoader`]: If your data source can provide an exact range of items (start index to end index).
- [`Loader`]: If none of the above fit your needs, you can implement this trait to provide your own loading logic.

Please refer to the documentation and the examples to see how to implement these traits.

### Components

This crate provides several components designed to help you with the pagination of data.
These components are:

- [`PaginatedFor`]: A component that displays a list of items in a paginated manner.
- [`PaginationPages`]: A component that displays the buttons to jump to a certain page.
- [`PaginationNext`]: A component that displays a button to navigate to the next page.
- [`PaginationPrev`]: A component that displays a button to navigate to the previous page.

Please refer to the examples to see how to use these components.

### Hooks

All components are just thin wrappers that add commonly used html to hook functions that implement the actual logic.
So if you want to customize your markup more than what the pre-made components allow you can use these hooks directly.

These are the hooks:

- [`use_pagination`]: Logic for [`PaginatedFor`]. Handles loading items on-demand from the data source and caching them.
- [`use_pagination_controls`]: Logic for [`PaginationPages`]. Returns page ranges that can be used to display pagination controls.

If you want to implement your own custom components using these hooks, please have a look at the pre-made components in this crate.
You'll see that there is really nothing special about them.

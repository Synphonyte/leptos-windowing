### A pagination example with a data source that uses server functions and sqlx.

To make this example work, you must download / fork the whole repo because this is in the Cargo.toml: `leptos-windowing = { path = "../.." }`.

If you don't have `cargo-leptos` installed you can install it with

```bash
cargo install cargo-leptos
```

To run the example execute

```bash
cargo leptos watch
```

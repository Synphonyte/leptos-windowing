//! Base Crate for Virtualization and pagination for Leptos.
//!
//! This crate contains common code for the crates leptos-pagination and leptos-virtualization.
//! You probably want don't want to use this crate directly.
//!
//! ## Loading data
//!
//! Wether you use pagination or virtualization you have to provide the data to display.
//! This is done through implementing one of the various `Loader` traits. Depending on your use case
//! you should implement the trait that best fits your needs:
//!
//! - [`MemoryLoader`]: If your dataset is already in memory like in a `Vec`, `HashSet`, array, ...
//! - [`PaginatedLoader`]: If your data source provides data in pages (independent of if you use UI pagination or virtualization).
//! - [`ExactLoader`]: If your data source can provide an exact range of items (start index to end index).
//! - [`Loader`]: If none of the above fit your needs, you can implement this trait to provide your own loading logic.
//!
//! Please refer to the documentation and the examples to see how to implement these traits.
